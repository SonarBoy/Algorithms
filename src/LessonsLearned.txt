Lessons Learned (Simple Mistake Documentation Sheet):

DEC 01 2020:
1) When including programming arguments in Eclipse use the whole file name and think like this moving forward.
Because IDE's dont recognize the "." when formatting arguments.  

2) Have a way to test before you start putting keys to the IDE otherwise you are just spinning your wheels.

3) Its better to go over a razor blade at a snails pace.

4) Dont push yourself needlessly and always ask yourself "HOW AM I GOING TO TEST THIS THING?"
