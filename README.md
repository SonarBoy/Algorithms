## Deques and Randomized Queues.
Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to 
implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.

## Collinear Points
Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points. 

Computer vision involves analyzing patterns in visual images and reconstructing the real-world objects that produced them. 
The process is often broken up into two phases: feature detection and pattern recognition. Feature detection involves selecting 
important features of the image; pattern recognition involves discovering patterns in the features. 
We will investigate a particularly clean pattern recognition problem involving points and line segments. 
This kind of pattern recognition arises in many other applications such as statistical data analysis.
